Placing down assemblers and other buildings from ghost entities now fulfills their module requests if you have the correct modules in your inventory.

So simple it should be vanilla!

# Compatibility

Supports modded buildings, quality, etc.

PyAlienLife buildings, when placed, will autofill with the best module you have in your inventory, but only if there are no module requests.

(todo) Py Reproductive Complex autofills with proper modules
